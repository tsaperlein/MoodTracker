# User Interface Design
## Deliverable 1

### Goal:
Identify and analyze problems related to assigned semester project. This should be done by means of user research techniques.

### Tasks:
- user research (done and reported by each team member)
    - analysis and interpretation of collected data (either from own user research or from sources of third parties - articles, books, etc.)
        - summary of knowledge gained
        - user requirements
- key problems to be solved (related/restricted to the user group and conducted research)
    - problems to be solved by future design
        - at least 3 relevant problems with a detailed description
    - emerging HCI problems

## Deliverable 2

### Goal:
Come up with possible solutions to user problems identified.

### Tasks:
- Scenarios describing problems to be solved
    - verbal description of scenarios
    - storyboards of key situations (related to scenarios)
- Model of the future solution
    - task description (a formal method must be used: HTA or CTT)
        - task descriptions are based on scenarios described above
    - sketches of main design ideas
- Paper mockups of future solution (as a result of the Design studio technique)
    - mockup must cover at least the key parts of the solution
        - it must be clearly shown how the design will help to solve problems identified
        - describe possible alternative solutions
    - must be uploaded on the server (photos of the paper mockup)
    - each team member creates at least one (part of) mockup
    - document the iterative nature of the design process
        - document (take photos) interesting intermediate results of the Design studio technique

**NOTE 1**: If you use HTA description do not forget to define so-called plans. These must be related to the scenarios.

## Deliverable 3

### Goal:
Convert the solution described in the D2 document into an interactive LoFi prototype and check them with the target user group. The prototype created should express the main ideas of your solutions to have the potential to verify your ideas by means of user testing.

### Tasks:
- prototype creation
    - pick up scenarios, which will be covered by the prototype (refer to previous deliverable D2)
    - interactive prototype (ready for user testing)
        - provide a link to the running prototype
        - upload it on the server (source, export to PDF/HTML/etc.)
        - provide brief documentation (text description and/or demo)
    - ensure that the prototype tackles problems described in deliverable D1/D2
        - the prototype should contain primarily parts that will be tested with users (their testing can contribute to the verification of your design ideas)
        - consider shallow prototyping only (no deep and detailed solutions of all parts of the prototype) - use the Wizard of Oz technique
- evaluation (each team member must perform at least 1 usability test)
    - the goal of evaluation (formulate which problems and design ideas from D1/D2 are we going to verify)
    - test setup (how the test was prepared - environment, artifacts used for testing, timing, etc.)
    - test execution (document how the test was performed - short video or sequence of photos/screenshots)
    - findings and recommendations (describe relevant observations during the test; indicate recommendations for further design)

**NOTE 1**: Details about usability testing can be found in lectures 5, 6, and 7 of the TUR course.

**NOTE 2**: Submit all the materials in one ZIP file.


## Deliverable 4

### Goal:
Push the LoFi prototype (created and tested in D3) to a higher level by means of its fidelity, interactivity, and illusion of the final design. With the HiFi prototype, you should be able to test your ideas and solutions which were not able to test with the LoFi prototype and which emerged during user testing.


### Tasks:
- prototype creation
    - the prototype must cover selected scenarios from D2
    - the “source code” must be uploaded
    - provide also a build of the prototype
        - can be a link to a running application
        - if not possible record a demo illustrating its functionality
    - the functionality of the prototype must be verbally described (adding screenshots is recommended)
    - the state-transition network (high level - do not go to all details) of the prototype must be created
    - the HW/SW technologies used for prototype creation must be specified
- evaluation (each team member must perform at least 1 usability test)
    - the goal of evaluation (which requirements are we going to test) must be defined.
    - the test setup must be precisely described including schema/photos of the setup).
    - the test execution must be documented (e.g. short video or sequence of photos/screenshots).
    - the findings and recommendations must be described in detail.
- documentation for developers (do not write all from the beginning, reuse what you have already done or refer to it in the text of previous deliverables)
    - specify functional requirements (with priorities)
        - the priorities should respect the goals and key issues your design is trying to solve
    - point out important design ideas from various relevant points of view - interaction design, visual design, and user experience design
        - if possible refer to your prototypes and previous deliverables
- presentation of D4 (all team members must actively present)
    - start with the story of your solution
    - present key features of your solution
    - more pictures less text
    - do not go into implementation details
    - 5 minutes presentation (short video/screen sequence describing “the story” of the solution + 3 slides)
    - send the slides (in PDF format) 1 day before the presentation (Sun 7. 1. 2024) to my email xmikovec [at] fel.cvut.cz

**NOTE**:
The report should be well structured (divided into chapters, and sections), and should be stylistically correct (proofreading, formal and technical language, usage of right
