## People

**People Differences:**

- **Physical**

    - Height/Weight
    - 5 Senses (Sight, Hearing, Touch, Smell, Taste)

- **Psychological**

    - Good signage and clear directions

        It is for people that have bad spatial ability, in order to find their way around much easier.

    - Language differences
    - Cultural differences
    - Attention/Stress differences

    **Mental Model:**
    User’s underlying expectations about how something should work. From past interactions with similar devices and from how something appears.

    *- How is it being developed?*
        
    - Interacting with the system.
    - Observing the relationship between their actions and the behaviors of the system.
    - Reading any manuals or other forms of explanation that come with a system

- **Social**

    - Different goals
    - Different motivation

## Activities

**Types:**

- Single / Continuous set of actions
- Interrupted

    Ensure that the user can ‘find his place’ again and pick up.

Make sure that the user doesn't make mistakes or leave important steps out of some activity.

**Response Time** should be considered.
    
- **Hand-eye coordination activities:** 
	About 100 milliseconds

- **Cause-effect relationship (*ex. clicking a button and something happening*):**
    1 second

**Safety** must be a priority (during accidents or mistakes)

## Contexts

It is important to consider the range of contexts and environments in which activities can take place.

**Types:**

- **Organisational**

    Changes in technology (*ex. deskilling* - reduce the level of skill required to carry out a job)

- **Social**

    Some examples:

    - Training manuals
    - Privacy issues
    - Differences between private interaction or public interaction

- **Physical environment**

    The physical environment in which activity happens is important (*ex. position of the ATM display depending on the sun's direction*). For my application I should ensure that it will be used in every geographically remote environment with ease (e*x. slow internet access*).

## Technologies

**Types:**

- **Input**

    Input devices are concerned with how people enter data and instructions into a system securely and safely.

- **Output**

    The most fundamental output device is the screen or monitor.

    Displaying content relies in 3 perceptual abilities:
    - Vision
    - Hearing

        Speech output is also an increasingly popular option

    - Touch

- **Communication**

    Wired connections such as
    - Telephone line
    - Ethernet network (fastest form)
