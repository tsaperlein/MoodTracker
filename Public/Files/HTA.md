## Course Management
### Professor's side
The Professor will create a course, by setting the name and the maximum number of the students (already knowing how many people attend his course). He will get a notification in order to allow the addition of a new student, depending on the sheet of the signed students. He will be able afterwards to change the name of the course, the maximum number of the students (possible mistake), add or remove a student and also delete the course.

### Student's side
