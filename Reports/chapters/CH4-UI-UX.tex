\chapter{User Interface and Experience Design}

This chapter outlines the essential steps that define the structure of the application and primarily focus on shaping its frontend. These steps are crucial in determining the tools and methods required to meet the application's demands before any coding begins. Among these steps are the creation of mockups, which establishes the layout and structure of the application's screens; the selection of design elements, which contribute to the aesthetic and user-friendly aspects of the interface; and finally, the searching of inspiration for screens and components, that align also with the final design of the mockups. These components guide the development of the application's necessary features and layout, ensuring both functionality and visual appeal.

\section{Mockups}

In this section, we design the mockups based on the requirements gathered in the previous chapter, ensuring that each design element aligns with the core functionalities of the application. For this purpose, I use \textbf{Figma}, a collaborative design tool widely used for creating user interfaces and prototypes. Figma allows for real-time collaboration and provides a streamlined interface for designing, testing, and refining mockups. Once the initial designs are complete, the mockups are evaluated to assess their usability, functionality, and alignment with user needs. Based on this evaluation, any necessary adjustments are made, leading to the final design of the mockups that are implemented in the application.

\subsection{Initial Design}

\noindent \textbf{Welcome Screen (Before Connection) [\ref{fig:welcome_1}]} \\
This is the initial screen that the user encounters when opening the application for the first time. It provides two button options:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Login}: When pressed, the user is navigated to the ``Login screen'', to login with an existing account.
    \item \textbf{Register}: When pressed, the user is navigated to the ``Registration screen'', where new users can create an account.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This screen is going to be designed to be simple and straightforward, ensuring ease of access for new and old users.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Welcome Screen (After Connection) [\ref{fig:welcome_2}]} \\
If the user has logged in the device a previous time, a geeting is shown with a personalized message, ``Welcome back, \{Name\}''. Below this greeting, the user is provided with the question ``How are you feeling today?'' and an Emoji Selector, which leads them to log their daily mood using emojis. On the other hand, if the logged-in account is incorrect (the correct name is shown), users can select one of the following buttons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Login}: When pressed, the user is navigated to the ``Login screen'', to login with a different account.
    \item \textbf{Register}: When pressed, the user is navigated to the ``Registration screen'', to create a new account, if they don't have one already.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Registration Screen [\ref{fig:registration}]} \\
This screen allows new users to create an account. Users must provide their:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First Name
    \item Last Name
    \item Email
    \item Password
    \item Password Confirmation
\end{itemize}

\noindent Thereâ€™s also a prompt for users who may already have an account, directing them back to the ``Login screen'' with the link ``Already having an account?''.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Login Screen [\ref{fig:login}]} \\
Users with an existing account can sign in by providing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Email
    \item Password
\end{itemize}

\noindent For users who do not yet have an account, a link is provided, ``Not having an account?''. This takes them to the ``Registration screen''.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Profile Screen [\ref{fig:profile}]} \\
This screen displays the user's profile information and can be accessed when pressing the avatar icon on the top right corner of some screens. The profile information consists of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Full Name
    \item Email
\end{itemize}

\noindent Users can choose to edit their profile by clicking the ``Edit Profile'' button. They are also given the option to Log Out.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Edit Profile Screen [\ref{fig:edit_profile}]} \\
In this screen, users can modify the profile information by pressing the ``Save Changes'' button shown in the top right corner of the ``Profile Screen''. The information contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First Name
    \item Last Name
    \item Email

    \item New Password
\end{itemize}

\noindent Upon making changes, users can save their updates by clicking the ``Save Changes'' button.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Main Menu Screen [\ref{fig:main_menu}]} \\
This is the central navigation hub of the application, that the user enters after logging in. It offers access to four key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Daily Survey}: Users can log their daily mood.
    \item \textbf{Previous Surveys}: Access previous mood logs and review past entries.
    \item \textbf{General Stats}: View statistics of mood data over time.
    \item \textbf{Journal}: Allows users to write personal reflections or entries.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Today's Survey Screen [\ref{fig:todays_survey}]} \\
This screen is accessed when the user selects the ``Daily Survey'' option from the ``Main Menu Screen''. It presents one of the question of the daily survey. In complete, the daily survey consists of 4-5 screens like the figure image, each displaying:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date}: The date that the survey was posted.
    \item \textbf{Question Number}: The number of the question that the user is currently.
    \item \textbf{Question Text}: The original question presented during the survey.
    \item \textbf{Answer Options}: The answer options of the questionnaire, in our case ``Not True'', ``Sometimes'', ``True''.
    \item \textbf{Comment Section}: The section where the user can leave a comment for explaining better the answer, thus their mood.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Also in the bottom section of the screen there are some action buttons, that depending on if the user is on the last question or not, it shows the ``Submit'' or the ``Continue'' button respactively.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Survey Menu Screen [\ref{fig:survey_menu}]} \\
This screen is displayed when the user selects the ``Previous Surveys'' option from the ``Main Menu Screen''. The screen is going to be scrollable and contains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Date}: The date that the survey was posted.

\subsection{Evaluation}

During the design process, we supervisor revisited the initial mockups with the objective of simplifying the user interface and focusing on only the most essential features of the application. After careful reflection on the functionality of each screen and discussions with my supervisor, it became clear that some screens could be reduced or merged to create a more streamlined and efficient user experience. The goal was to minimize unnecessary complexity and ensure that the app remained as simple and focused as possible, aligning with the overall aim of the thesis.\vspace{5mm} \\
Key modifications include reducing the number of screens and removing non-essential elements, such as the journal feature, which was identified as adding too much information and detracting from the core functionality of the app. The resulting design emphasizes a minimalist and straightforward approach, prioritizing clarity and simplicity over unnecessary features, ensuring that the app serves its primary purpose effectively.\vspace{5mm} \\
Firstly, the ``Welcome Screen'' was simplified into a single screen that greets the user daily, whether they log in or register. In the updated design, the ``Welcome Screen'' prompts the user to select a mood for the day, called the ``Welcome Mood''. This update creates a more engaging daily interaction with the app, encouraging users to immediately log their mood, which is then reflected in the statistics.\vspace{5mm} \\
In terms of navigation, the ``Main Menu Screen'' has undergone several improvements. Instead of a button for the ``Questionnaires Screen'', this option is part of a navigation bar, making it easier to access without cluttering the main screen. The ``Daily Message'', either a quote or advice, is more personalized to provide users with a motivational or reflective element every day. Additionally, the ``Data Projection'' feature shows a smaller version of the overall statistics, giving users a quick snapshot of their mood trends and questionnaire results.\vspace{5mm} \\
The ``Statistics Screens'' were refined to better reflect the user's mood and questionnaire data. The ``Calendar Screen'' projects the ``Welcome Moods'' that the user logs each day, providing a clear and visual history of daily moods. The ``Graph Screen'' is responsible for projecting the results from the questionnaires, allowing users to track how their answers have evolved over time.\vspace{5mm} \\
In the ``Survey Screens'', some adjustments were made to improve clarity and flow. In the updated design of the ``Today's Survey Screen'', the user navigates through the survey with a ``Continue'' button for intermediate questions and a ``Submit'' button for the final question, because it submits the whole survey. Similarly, the ``Previous Survey Screen'' maintains the same structure as the updated ``Today's Survey Screen'' but has additional navigation options. These include an ``Exit'' button, allowing the user to leave the survey, and a ``Continue'' button to navigate through all previously answered questions, except for the final question, which doesn't have a next question. Also included the points of the survey, so the user knows beforehand what the score for each individual survey is. This structure ensures a smoother and more intuitive user experience when interacting with surveys.\vspace{5mm} \\
Finally, the ``Profile Screen'' has also been improved, with options to update or delete the profile image, adding further customization to the userâ€™s experience. Also combined the old mockup screens of the ``Profile'' and ``Edit Profile'' into one, just by containing the profile information in input fields, and updating the changes with the ``Edit'' button.\vspace{5mm} \\
In addition, we introduced two new screens: ``Request Password Reset'' and ``Reset Password''. These screens were added to enhance the user experience by offering a straightforward process for account recovery. The ``Request Password Reset'' screen enables users to initiate a password reset request, while the ``Reset Password'' screen allows users to set a new password after receiving a reset link. These screens provide essential functionality for account security and recovery, improving the overall user experience.
\vspace{5mm} \\
These changes reflect our commitment to creating an application that is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and functional, addressing the feedback and challenges identified during the evaluation process.

\section{Core Design Elements}

With the completion of all mockup screens, we turn our focus to defining the core design elements of the application, including colors, fonts, and icons. These design choices are based on the application research conducted in Chapter 2, alongside more in-depth personal research specific to each design aspect.

\subsection{Colors}

To design the color scheme for the application, we first conducted thorough research into color theory, principles, and best practices. The goal was to ensure that the selected colors would not only enhance the visual appeal but also align with the emotional tone and purpose of the app. This process involved exploring theoretical concepts, practical experimentation, and considerations for user interface design. \\

\noindent \textbf{Research and Resources} \\
To develop an effective color palette, a significant number of resources were used, like:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Adobe Documentation on Color Psychology \cite{adobe-color}} \\
    This documentation provided a comprehensive understanding of color meanings and symbolism. It explored how different colors evoke specific emotions and psychological responses, which helped in aligning the application's color choices with its purpose of mood tracking. The guide also offered tips on choosing brand colors that appeal to users and create a consistent design.
    \vspace{5mm}
    \item \textbf{YouTube Videos} \\
    A variety of useful YouTube videos were used to understand basic principles and serve as a valuable guide throughout the design process. Some of them are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-SD_zV9S2c}{The 60-30-10 Rule in Color Theory}} \\
        Link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-SD_zV9S2c}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdJTnYqhaZQ}{Brand Colors Selection}} \\
        Link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdJTnYqhaZQ}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Zw7CbM-ps}{Logo Color Selection}} \\
        Link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Zw7CbM-ps}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5AnzLg1HxY}{Design Color Palettes}} \\
        Link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5AnzLg1HxY}
        \item \textbf{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXcKOqviLE0}{Apply Color Palette to Design}} \\
        Link: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXcKOqviLE0}
    \end{itemize}    

    \noindent The YouTube videos provided valuable insights into various aspects of color theory and its practical application in design. The 60-30-10 rule helped in understanding how to balance primary (brand), secondary, and accent colors to create visually appealing and balanced designs. Videos on brand and logo color selection emphasized the importance of choosing colors that reflect the application's identity and purpose. Additionally, tutorials on creating and applying color palettes to design ensured a deeper understanding of how to build appealing palettes that work well together across different elements, while maintaining readability and accessibility. These resources helped me create some possible color palettes for the application, so we can test and evaluate each of them.
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Color Testing and Tools} \\
Once a solid theoretical foundation is established, we can test the potential color schemes using \textbf{Figma}, experimenting with brand, secondary, and accent colors. The goal was to identify color combinations that worked harmoniously together while ensuring readability and accessibility across various backgrounds. To further refine our choices, we employed several online tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel}{Adobe Color Wheel}}: A tool for experimenting with different color harmonies and combinations. \\
    Link: \url{https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://huemint.com/}{Huemint}}: Useful for visualizing how the selected colors would appear on a website platform. \\
    Link: \url{https://huemint.com/}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://coolors.co/}{Coolors}}: Helpful for generating strong color palettes. \\
    Link: \url{https://coolors.co/}
    \item \textbf{\href{https://colorhunt.co/}{Color Hunt}}: Provided access to well-tested color palettes, helping us refine our choices. \\
    Link: \url{https://colorhunt.co/}
\end{itemize}


\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Final Color Choices} \\
Using these valuable tools, we decided that the application should use shades of blue and shades of green as its brand colors. Blue is chosen as the primary color, expressing calmness, trust, and reliability, while green serves as the accent color, representing growth, balance, and positivity.\vspace{5mm} \\
Drawing inspiration from previous applications, particularly for the emoji selector, we selected specific colors to represent the different moods in the ``Welcome Mood'' emojis. The colors for the five emojis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Awful}: A shade of dark red, symbolizing intense negative emotions.
    \item \textbf{Sad}: A blend of red and orange, reflecting a muted sense of distress.
    \item \textbf{Neutral}: A shade of yellow, representing balance and neutrality.
    \item \textbf{Good}: A vibrant shade of green, denoting positive emotions.
    \item \textbf{Happy}: A light and calming shade of blue, expressing happiness and positivity.
\end{itemize}

\noindent For text and other interface elements, the shades of blue and green are applied appropriately to maintain visual consistency and alignment with the application's tone.\vspace{5mm} \\
Additionally, basic colors such as white, black, and shades of gray are used throughout the design. White offers a clean and simple background, enhancing readability, while black provides contrast for text and important elements. The various shades of gray are employed for neutral backgrounds and subtle distinctions between UI components. As mentioned in the resources, using neutral tones like gray, black, and white helps maintain balance in the color scheme, ensuring that the brand colors and accents stand out without overwhelming the user interface.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Shading} \\
After selecting the core colors for the application, we employed a technique from one of the referenced YouTube videos, along with the \textbf{\href{https://maketintsandshades.com/}{Tint and Shade Generator}}\footnote{Link: \url{https://maketintsandshades.com/}} tool, to generate various shades of the selected colors. The purpose of these shades is to provide a more versatile and united color scheme throughout the application.\vspace{5mm} \\
To create a consistent and balanced interface, nine different shades were generated for each primary and accent color. This approach ensures that we have lighter and darker variations of each color, which can be used for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lighter shades}: For backgrounds, highlighting, or less dominant elements.
    \item \textbf{Darker shades}: For text, buttons, or to emphasize important components.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Of course, this also applies vice versa, like using darker shades for the background of a screen and lighter shades for the text of it.\vspace{5mm} \\
The technique used to create the shades ensures consistency across different colors, allowing the shades of various colors to maintain a similar visual structure. This approach stabilizes the design, meaning that if a blue shade is swapped with a green shade in the future, the overall interface retains its united look and feel. By ordering the shades properly, the application remains visually consistent, even when colors changes.\vspace{5mm} \\
Below the final color palette is shown, so we can notice the consistency of the shades when switching between the colors:

\noindent Finally, we added two levels of transparency (alpha levels) for the primary colors (blue, green, gray, etc.). These transparent variations (alpha=0.7 and alpha=0.5) are particularly useful when smoother transitions between colors are needed in the application, creating a more smooth and satisfying user experience. The transparent colors allow elements like overlays, backgrounds, or hover effects to blend seamlessly with the rest of the design.

\subsection{Fonts}
For the font selection, I wanted to find a modern, pleasant font that complements the overall character of the application. After careful consideration, I chose the ``Outfit'' font for its smooth curves and ``up to date feel'', making it a natural fit for the appâ€™s interface. Multiple variations of ``Outfit'' are included (Regular, Medium, Bold) to provide flexibility for different text elements within the app.\vspace{5mm} \\
Additionally, I included the ``Roboto'' font, which is widely supported on both iOS and Android. This ensures that in case the primary fonts fail to load during the development or usage, the app maintains readability and consistency across platforms. The ``FjallaOne'' font is used in specific cases where a slimmer, sleeker look is desired for the text.\vspace{5mm} \\
Lastly, the ``Press Start 2P'' font, famously used in Googleâ€™s dinosaur game when the internet connection is down, has been included for a specific animation within the app. This choice allows for a fun feel that mimics the Google animationâ€™s style.\vspace{5mm} \\
The fonts that we are going to work with in the developement phase, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outfit}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Regular (Outfit-Regular.ttf)
        \item Medium (Outfit-Medium.ttf)
        \item Bold (Outfit-Bold.ttf)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Roboto}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Regular (Roboto-Regular.ttf)
        \item Italic (Roboto-Italic.ttf)
        \item Medium (Roboto-Medium.ttf)
        \item Medium Italic (Roboto-MediumItalic.ttf)
        \item Bold (Roboto-Bold.ttf)
        \item Bold Italic (Roboto-BoldItalic.ttf)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FjallaOne}:
\begin{itemize} \item Regular (FjallaOne-Regular.ttf) \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Press Start 2P}:
\begin{itemize} \item Regular (PressStart2P-Regular.ttf) \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Icons}

For the icons that are going to be used in the application, I initially searched for SVG files, some of which I found online or created myself. However, after discovering that Expo offers a comprehensive library of vector icons (available at \textbf{\href{https://icons.expo.fyi/Index}{Expo Vector Icons}}\footnote{Link: \url{https://icons.expo.fyi/Index}}), I decided to rely on this resource. Expo Vector Icons provide a wide variety of scalable, customizable icons that flawless merge with the application.\vspace{5mm} \\
In the app's development, I am using these icons for key navigation elements, such as the ``Home Screen'' and the ``Questionnaires Screen'' in the bottom navigation bar. Additional icons are also selected from the Expo library for smaller features and functionalities.\vspace{5mm} \\
The icons used for the ``Welcome Mood'' on the ``Welcome Screen'' and ``Calendar Screen'' are as follows:

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\noindent The ``Nothing'' emoji is used in instances when the user chooses not to respond or does not want to select a specific emoji for their mood. This option ensures that the user does not feel pressured to choose a mood if they are undecided or wish to skip the step without providing a specific input.\vspace{5mm} \\
The other five icons - ``Awful'', ``Sad'', ``Neutral'', ``Good'', and ``Happy'' â€“ are easy to understand and provide clear differences in emotional states, visually representing a spectrum from negative to positive feelings. These icons are designed to capture a climactic progression, ensuring that each ``Welcome Mood'' is distinct and projects an easily recognizable emotional difference. This not only helps the user identify their feelings more clearly, but also makes it easier to visualize mood trends over time when projected in the ``Calendar Screen''.\vspace{5mm} \\
Furthermore, these moods perfectly align with the core question ``How are you feeling today?'', that is been shown in the ``Welcome Screen''. Each icon serves to provide a quick and natural response, encouraging user engagement while also ensuring the process of logging daily moods remains simple and meaningful.

\subsection{Animations}

For the applicationâ€™s animations, I thought of using SVG files, but as mentioned in the Icons subsection, they make the implementation more difficult. Based on this, I plan to use pre-made Lottie animations from \textbf{\href{https://lottiefiles.com/}{LottieFiles}}\footnote{Link: \url{https://lottiefiles.com/}}. These animations are not only visually pleasing but also easy to implement, and they come in two formats: small animations and full-screen animations (such as splash screens). I intend to use them on the welcome screen to create a warm, engaging experience for users when they first open the app.\vspace{5mm} \\
Additionally, Lottie animations are embodied to signal the completion of surveys, increase user satisfaction. They are also used for the loading screen and the main splash screen of the application, giving it a polished and dynamic feel. Lastly, I plan to integrate these animations into any features that involve completion, loading, or other processes that require some time to complete, providing users with a smooth and visually engaging experience throughout the app.

\section{Inspiration for Design}

For inspiration when designing the screens and components of the application, I was inspired by the research conducted on other mood tracking apps, as discussed in Chapter 2. However, a significant portion of my design inspiration came from \textbf{\href{https://dribbble.com/following}{Dribbble}}\footnote{Link: \url{https://dribbble.com/following}}, a platform that promotes work by designers and developers from around the world. Dribbble is a hub for creativity where professionals share their designs for various digital products, including mobile apps, websites, and user interfaces.\vspace{5mm} \\
What makes Dribbble particularly useful is its search functionality, allowing users to explore an extensive library of visual ideas across a variety of categories. While the site primarily serves as a portfolio platform for designers who offer their services for hire, it also provides an excellent source of inspiration. By browsing through design concepts, even though they are available only as static images without code, you can gain valuable insights into layout, color schemes, and interaction ideas.\vspace{5mm} \\
Using Dribbble, I was able to gather inspiration for key components and screens that I plan to implement in my application. As we proceed further down, I describe the specific screens and components that were affected by this research.

\subsection{Screens}

\noindent \textbf{Profile} \\
For the Profile screen, I was inspired by the sleek and modern design of input fields. The simple and smooth combination of colors between the fields and the background creates a clean and organized look. I particularly liked how the information is displayed in editable text input fields, allowing users to quickly make changes by pressing the ``Done'' button at the top right. Additionally, I appreciate the layout of the avatar image, positioned above the fields, leaving space (left and right) for potential action buttons, such as ``Update'' or ``Delete'' for profile image modifications.

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Home} \\
The Home screen design is visually appealing and well-organized. I am particularly drawn to the layout, which divides the content into three distinct sections. Each section holds relevant information in a clean, readable format. The navigation bar at the bottom is especially well designed, and I intend to incorporate this concept into my application to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Components}

\noindent \textbf{Calendar} \\
For the calendar component in the ``Calendar Screen'', I found two compelling designs that both use emojis to represent user moods. I plan to implement a similar concept for tracking the userâ€™s ``Welcome Moods'' in my application. This allows for better visualization of the user's emotional data in a clear and straightforward manner, displaying only the most important infromation, the mood, the date, and the month-year format. The calendar features the same emojis that users select on the Welcome screen, ensuring consistency across the app.

\FloatBarrier

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Graph} \\
When it comes to displaying data in the form of graphs in the ``Graph Screen'', I found two bar chart designs that I find both simple and effective. The idea is to show the user's survey results using vertical bars, with different colors representing varying scores. This makes it easier for users to quickly explain their performance without having to analyze complex data. I plan to use different colors to indicate low, average, and high scores for the completed questionnaires.

\noindent \textbf{Weekly Stats} \\
The Monthly Stats component from the picture [\ref{fig:weekly_stats}], which is featured as Weekly Stats on the Home screen of the applciation, provides a compact yet informative overview of the userâ€™s mood data. This design, inspired by the Home screen layout, is scrollable and contains only the most essential details, making it easy to navigate and comprehend. This small version of the calendar data gives users a quick snapshot of their mood history.

\FloatBarrier

\vspace{5mm}

\noindent \textbf{Header} \\
For the header component, I was inspired from a design that incorporates a friendly, personalized greeting, such as ``Hello, \{User Name\}''. This adds a personal touch to the userâ€™s experience. Below the greeting, the application displays additional information, but instead of showing a health score or pro member status (as seen in the example [\ref{fig:header}], I plan to include the userâ€™s streak and an icon indicating whether they have completed that day's survey. The avatar is placed on the right side, and pressing it can navigate users to the Profile screen.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter, we focused on designing an application that is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly. By developing a clear structure and incorporating elements such as colors, fonts, icons, and animations, we aimed to create an interface that is both engaging and easy to navigate. The choice of design elements is crucial for fostering a sense of safety and trust among users, encouraging them to use the application consistently. This foundation will support students in feeling comfortable and secure while interacting with the app. In the next chapter, we turn our attention to the technical implementation, bringing the design concepts and research insights into reality.
