# Mood and Feelings Questionnaire
## Definition
**MFQ** (Costello & Angold, 1988) is a 33‐item questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks, with responses rated on a 3‐point scale (0 = not true, 1 = sometimes, and 2 = true). Total scores range from 0 to 66, with a score ≥29 commonly used in the literature to indicate clinically significant depression.

## SMFQ
### Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire
The **SMFQ** is a 13‐item shortened version of the 33‐item **MFQ** and was developed in response to the need for a brief depression measure to reduce participant burden in research trials, while still retaining strong criterion validity. It assesses depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks. Responses are rated on a 3‐point scale (0 = not true, 1 = sometimes, and 2 = true). Like the MFQ, the SMFQ has matching versions completed by the parent (**SMFQ‐P**) and the child or adolescent (**SMFQ‐C**), and both are freely available.
