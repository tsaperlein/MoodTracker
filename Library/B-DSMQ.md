#  Bi-Dimensional Structure Questionnaire of Social Mentality
## Definition
The B-DSMQ is a psychometric tool designed to measure social mentality, specifically focusing on two key dimensions: **"individual–public"** and **"positive–negative"**. This questionnaire is structured to capture various aspects of individuals' attitudes and behaviors within social contexts, considering both personal perspectives and broader societal influences.
## Structure
1. **Dimensions and Components**: The B-DSMQ is structured into two primary dimensions:
    - **Individual–Public Dimension**: This dimension explores how individuals perceive social mentality both personally (individual level) and collectively (public or societal level).
    - **Positive–Negative Dimension**: This dimension assesses the valence or emotional tone of social mentality, covering both positive and negative aspects.

2. **Content and Items**: The questionnaire consists of 46 words or phrases that represent different aspects of social mentality. These items are categorized into:
    - **Positive Social Mentality (PSM)**: Reflects positive attitudes and behaviors within social contexts.
    - **Negative Social Mentality (NSM)**: Reflects negative attitudes and behaviors within social contexts.
    - **Balanced Social Mentality (BSM)**: Represents the overall balance between positive and negative social mentality.

3. **Subscales**:
    - **Positive Individual Mentality (PIM)**: Positive attitudes at the individual level.
    - **Negative Individual Mentality (NIM)**: Negative attitudes at the individual level.
    - **Positive Public Mentality (PPbM)**: Positive attitudes at the societal/public level.
    - **Negative Public Mentality (NPbM)**: Negative attitudes at the societal/public level.

4. **Item Presentation and Scoring**: Participants are presented with specific phrases or descriptions related to social mentality (e.g., being hopeful, honest, supportive) and asked to rate them from two perspectives:
    - **Personal Standpoint**: How they personally perceive each item.
    - **Public Standpoint**: How they believe the general public or society perceives each item.

5. **Response Scale**: Responses are recorded using a 6-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 6 (mostly). Participants indicate the extent to which each item aligns with their viewpoints.

6. **Calculations and Interpretation**: The BSM score is calculated as the difference between PSM and NSM (BSM = PSM - NSM), representing the overall balance of positive and negative social mentality. A higher BSM score indicates a more positive overall social mentality.

8. **Reliability and Validity**: The questionnaire's reliability and validity have been confirmed through previous studies, including assessments of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) to ensure the questionnaire's accuracy and consistency in measuring social mentality.
