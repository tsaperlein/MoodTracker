# CBT (Congitive Behavioral Therapy)

## What is CBT?
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of talking therapy. It is a common treatment for a range of mental health problems. 

CBT teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems. It focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and actions.

## How does CBT work?
CBT can help you to change how you think ('Cognitive') and what you do ('Behaviour'). These changes can help you to feel better. Unlike some of the other talking treatments, it focuses on the 'here and now' problems and difficulties. Instead of focusing on the causes of your distress or symptoms in the past, it looks for ways to improve your state of mind now.
