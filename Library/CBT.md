# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

## Defintion
CBT is a type of talking therapy that can help you to change how you think ('Cognitive') and what you do ('Behaviour'). It is a common treatment for a range of mental health problems. It basically teaches you coping skills for dealing with different problems and focuses on how your thoughts, beliefs and attitudes affect your feelings and actions.

CBT can help you to change how you think ('Cognitive') and what you do ('Behaviour'). These changes can help you to feel better. Unlike some of the other talking treatments, it focuses on the 'here and now' problems and difficulties. Instead of focusing on the causes of your distress or symptoms in the past, it looks for ways to improve your state of mind now.
