### Definition
The Schwartz Value Survey (Schwartz, 1992) is a 56-item measure of 11 motivational value types: Achievement, Benevolence, Conformity, Hedonism, Power, Security, Self-Direction, Stimulation, Spirituality, Tradition, and Universalism. There are 56 values representing these types, each accompanied by a brief description.
### Procedure
Sample items are as follows: "Politeness (courtesy, good manners)," "Unity with nature (fitting into nature)," and "Loyal (faithful to my friends, group)." Respondents are asked to rate each value "as a guiding principle in my life," using a 9-point scale.
## Structure
Items were derived from Schwartz's structural model of values, which outlines three universal requirements thought to be at the root of values: needs of individuals as biological organisms, requisites of coordinating social interaction, and requirements for the functioning of society and the survival of groups. Of the values, 21 are identical to those in the Rokeach Value Survey (Rokeach, 1973). In samples of individuals from 20 countries, the meaning of the values and value types was found to be reasonably equivalent across most groups. In addition, two basic dimensions that organize value systems into an integrated motivational structure with consistent value conflicts and compatibilities were established.
