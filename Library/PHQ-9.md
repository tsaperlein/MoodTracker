# Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire

## What is PHQ-9?
PHQ-9 is a depressive symptom scale and diagnostic tool introduced in 2001 to screen adult patients in primary care settings. The instrument assesses for the presence and severity of depressive symptoms and a possible depressive disorder. The PHQ-9 is a component of the larger self-administered Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), but can be used as a stand-alone instrument. The PHQ is part of Pfizer's larger suite of trademarked products, called the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD). The PHQ-9 takes less than three minutes to complete. It is scored by simply adding up the individual items' scores. Each of the nine items reflects a DSM-5 symptom of depression. Primary care providers can use the PHQ-9 to screen for possible depression in patients.
## Procedure
Each question typically requires the respondent to rate the frequency of these symptoms over the past two weeks on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more than half the days, 3 = nearly every day). The total score (ranging from 0 to 27) helps healthcare professionals gauge the severity of depressive symptoms and guide further assessment or treatment.
