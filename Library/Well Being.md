# Types of well-being

## 1. Hedonic well-being

**Hedonic** well-being is associated with pleasure and enjoyment. It is the type of well-being that is most commonly associated with the word "happiness" and measured in happiness surveys.

## 2. Eudaimonic well-being

**Eudaimonic** well-being is associated with meaning and purpose in life. It is most commonly associated with the word "flourishing" and measured in psychological surveys.

## Abstract
Current research on well-being has been derived from two general perspectives: the **Hedonic** approach, which focuses on happiness and defines well-being in terms of pleasure attainment and pain avoidance; and the **Eudaimonic** approach, which focuses on meaning and self-realization and defines well-being in terms of the degree to which a person is fully functioning.
