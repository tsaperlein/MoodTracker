# MoodTracker

Application that tracks the mood of the students and sends feedback to the teachers.

## Summary

The application focuses on tracking the mood of the students by asking for feedback from them, such as daily emojis or answers to some psychological questions or for direct feedback. Then the received information is sent anonymously to the teachers, who then take corresponding actions. The app provides mood tracking for the students and also for the teachers. The teachers can see the mood of all the students (assigned to his/her course) in the form of a graph, which is updated in real time. The app also provides a chat for the students and teachers to communicate with each other. The app also provides a emoji calendar for the students to see their progress.

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
