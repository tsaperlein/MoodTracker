# Usage of Application
## Both Sides
- Register or Login.

## Professor's Side

- The professors can create a course, defining the name, the maximum amount of students and the course tasks for the semester.

When they enter a course they will be able to:
- Create 2-3 questions each week, asking about their course.
- Save the questions for later.
- Collect anonymously the data, after the students have replied to their questions.
- See all the answers that the students gave them (for each week).
- See submitted or saved questions.
- Take actions and report them in the respective place inside the app, depending on the mentality of the students.
- Change the course information and also accept, decline or kick off students from the course.

- The data is being generated based on their answers on the psychology and also on the direct part of their surveys.
Of course, each professor will receive the answers referring to their course only.

## Student's Side
- They connect by selecting an emoji.
- The students can add courses that they attend during the semester.

When they enter a course they will be able to:
- See the questions from the respective professor (only the answered ones).
- See their results in a graph or calendar.

# Survey
## Two types of questions
#### Psychology Questions:
There will be questions asking about the psychology/mentality of the students. The frequency of these questions will be everyday or every two days, depends on the opinion of the students during the ***User Tests***. I thought that the amount of the psychology questions should be three to four, in order not to exhaust the students.
#### Direct Questions:
I have thought that the professors should be able to write their own questions, asking about the workload of their courses, tests, projects, exams etc. Being a student currently myself, I have thought that the amount of the professors' questions should be maximum two.
If the professors don't write 2-3 questions every week, asking about their course, then I will add some of the default questions that I have.

*P.S. I must know beforehand the parts that the course consists of (tests and frequency, laboratories and frequency, individual/team project (assessment), exam).*
## Final result
The total amount of the questions should be 5-6 every day (3-4 psychology + 2 direct {from 2 courses}).
The psychology questions will be consistent from 3-4 every day.
The direct questions, for each course, will be every 2-3 days, depending on the amount of the courses of the student.
