# Validation of the short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire in young adulthood

## About

The article investigates the validity of the short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (sMFQ) as a measure of depression in young adults. The study examines its effectiveness in identifying DSM-5 Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) at age 25 using a sample from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).

## Key Findings:

1. Validity and Accuracy: The sMFQ demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between cases and non-cases of MDD in young adults, with a high area under the curve (AUC) value.

2. Optimal Cut-Points: The commonly used adolescent cut-point of ≥12 was found to be effective at age 25, balancing sensitivity and specificity. A lower cut-point of ≥10 was suggested for scenarios where higher sensitivity is required, such as initial screenings.

3. Sex Differences: Sensitivity analyses indicated similar results for males and females, supporting the validity of the sMFQ across genders.

4. Internal Consistency: The sMFQ showed excellent internal consistency with a high Cronbach's alpha value.

## Practical Implications:

- The sMFQ can be used to screen for and monitor depression from adolescence through young adulthood.

- It is a quick and free tool, beneficial in both research and clinical settings, especially during the transition from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) to adult mental health services (AMHS).

## Conclusion:

The study concludes that the sMFQ is a valid and reliable measure for assessing depression in young adults and can be effectively used across a broad age range. This facilitates the continuity of depression monitoring and research from adolescence into adulthood.

# Cut Points

        NPV: 96.3%

## Interpretation for Users:

- Low Cut-Points (e.g., ≥ 6, ≥ 7): High sensitivity but lower specificity. These thresholds are useful for initial screenings where it is important to identify as many potential cases of depression as possible, even if it includes more false positives.

- Moderate Cut-Points (e.g., ≥ 10, ≥ 11): Good balance between sensitivity and specificity. These cut-points are useful in settings where a balance between identifying true positives and minimizing false positives is needed.

- High Cut-Points (e.g., ≥ 14, ≥ 15): Lower sensitivity but higher specificity. These thresholds are useful when it is crucial to reduce the number of false positives, ensuring that those identified are very likely to have depression.

- Optimal Cut-Point (≥ 12): Best trade-off between sensitivity (83.6%) and specificity (85.5%). Suitable for general use in both research and clinical practice.

## Contextual Use:

Research Settings: The cut-point of ≥ 12 can be used where both sensitivity and specificity are important to balance.
Clinical Screenings: The cut-point of ≥ 10 can be favored for initial screenings to avoid missing potential cases, followed by further clinical assessment to confirm diagnosis.
These cut-points and corresponding results enable the accurate identification and monitoring of depression symptoms in young adults using the sMFQ.

# About Students

The results from the short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (sMFQ) can provide detailed insights into the mood and potential depressive symptoms of students. Here’s a breakdown of what various score ranges on the sMFQ indicate about the mood of the students:

## Score Ranges and Interpretations:

1. Score of 0-5:

- Interpretation: Indicates very low or no depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student is likely to be in a good mood and not experiencing significant distress related to depression.

2. Score of 6-9:

- Interpretation: Low to mild depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student might be experiencing some mild depressive symptoms. While not indicative of major depression, it suggests some emotional distress or mood issues that may benefit from monitoring.

3. Score of 10-12:

- Interpretation: Moderate depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student is likely experiencing moderate levels of depressive symptoms. This score range suggests that the student might benefit from a more detailed evaluation by a mental health professional.

4. Score of 13-15:

- Interpretation: Moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student is experiencing significant depressive symptoms. It indicates a higher level of distress and the potential need for intervention or support.

5. Score of 16-19:

- Interpretation: Severe depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student is likely experiencing severe depressive symptoms. This score range suggests a high level of distress and an urgent need for a comprehensive clinical evaluation and possible treatment.

6. Score of 20-26:

- Interpretation: Very severe depressive symptoms.
- Mood Insight: The student is experiencing very severe depressive symptoms. Immediate attention from mental health professionals is highly recommended to address potential major depression and associated risks, such as suicidal thoughts.

## Practical Application in an Educational Setting:

- Screening and Support: Schools can use the sMFQ scores to screen for students who may need additional emotional support or mental health services. Students with moderate to severe scores (≥ 12) should be prioritized for further assessment and intervention.

- Preventative Measures: Regular administration of the sMFQ can help in early identification of mood issues, allowing for timely preventative measures and support.

- Mental Health Programs: The data can inform the development and implementation of school-wide mental health programs and initiatives, tailored to address the needs of students across different score ranges.

## Summary of Actionable Insights Based on Scores:

- Low Scores (0-5): Generally positive mood, low need for intervention.

- Mild Scores (6-9): Monitor for emerging issues, consider light support.

- Moderate Scores (10-12): Suggest further evaluation, consider counseling.

- Moderate-Severe Scores (13-15): Recommend mental health support and intervention.

- Severe Scores (16-19): Urgent need for comprehensive evaluation and intervention.

- Very Severe Scores (20-26): Immediate mental health intervention required.

These insights help in understanding and addressing the mood and mental health needs of students effectively.
