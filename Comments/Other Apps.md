# Comparative Analysis of Existing Mood-Tracking Apps

I am doing a user research for apps that can track your mood. The main idea of my app is that i want to track the mood of the students and send it anonymously to the professors. An app with this specific topic doesn't exist. I will give some feedback about the apps that i found and i want to write a paragraph about my opinions about the other apps and at what will my app do better.
