# Ideas for Development

## 1. Guide for understanding the application
Only in the beginning of the app, to explain the purpose of the app and how to use it
## 2. The app doesn't collect any data from the user
Does not track specific information, monitor user's location, or collect identifiable data about him/her

Also, the app will not sell the data to any third party applications.
## 3. Journal for the user
- Date
- Time
- Title
- Content

**Gratitude journal:** This journal helps in finding the right balance of positives in life. This can be a life-changing tool for many users.
**Tip:** The user can write positive things that happened to him/her during the day
**Important Feature:** The journal should not disappear after the user closes the app
## 4. Chat between students and teachers
- Students can contact their teachers if no actions have been taken
- Students propose ideas that will benefit with their anxiety (anonymously)
## 5. Add context for the anxiety trigger
Worry-inducing scenario was hypothetical, real, or unknown
## 6. Find a way to make students take notes
Take notes about:
- Steps they took to alleviate their anxiety
- Any additional thoughts that came up for me
## 7. Add suggestions/exercises for the students
- Breathing exercise (maybe with supporting voice or music, but not necessary)
- Meditation exercise
- Sleep, lifestyle and nutrition tips
- Exercise tips
- CBT tools
- Links to additional resources

**Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)** is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave. It's most commonly used to treat anxiety and depression, but can be useful for other mental and physical health problems.
## 8. Positive affirmations
- Inspirational quotes
- General affirmations
- Simple strategies for anxiety management (such as “Identify the controllable” and “Focus on the present moment”)
- Positive idioms.

**Important Feature:** A tab labeled “Note” to allow users create their own, personalized affirmations.
## 9. Form for the students
- 3-5 questions
- The questions should be simple and easy to answer
- 2 options for the answers (emoji or text)
- Good ammount of answers (not too much, not too little)

**Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)** is a multipurpose instrument for screening, diagnosing, monitoring and measuring the severity of depression
## 10. None time-consuming feature

## 11. Keep the user engaged
- Notification every day
- Option to create custom reminders
- Present functions that would automatically alert the user if absence of activity is detected
## 12. Capture the user's attention (clicks, swipes, etc.)
- Phone usage patterns
- Cognitive performance
- Time of day (of the app usage)
## 13. Wristband feature
- Tracking motor activity and sleep movements (Parkison's and PTSD)
- Predicting sleep patterns
- Classifying user activity
- Providing information about phone orientation
## 14. Photo for each course (Future Idea)
I can reccomend some pictures, depending on the subject of the course (methematics, business, programming etc.)
